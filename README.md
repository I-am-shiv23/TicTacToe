How to Play
The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
Player 1 is X, and Player 2 is O. Players take turns placing their symbols on the grid.
The first player to get 3 of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
If all 9 squares are filled and no player has 3 in a row, the game ends in a draw.
